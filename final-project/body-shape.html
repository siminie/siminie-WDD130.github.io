                    What is your Body Shape?
                </h2>
                <p>Body shape is a complex phenomenon with sophisticated detail and function. The general shape or
                    figure of a person is defined mainly by the molding of skeletal structures, as well as the
                    distribution of muscles and fat.
                    Bodies come in all different shapes and sizes.
                    It‚Äôs important to know that there isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù or ‚Äútypical‚Äù body.
                    Some of us are curvier, some of us have narrower hips or broader shoulders ‚Äî we‚Äôre all a little bit
                    different.
                    Still, most of us can categorize our shape into a few broad categories. Some of the common
                    categories include rectangle, triangle, inverted triangle and hourglass.

                <h2>Triangle</h2>
                <p>With this shape, your shoulders and bust are narrower than your hips.
                    You probably have slim arms and a fairly defined waist. Your waist most likely slopes out to your
                    hips.
                    Stylists often recommend clothing that shows off the waistline.

            <section>
                <h2>Inverted Triangle</h2>
                <p>If your shoulders and bust are larger than your relatively narrow hips, you have what‚Äôs known as an
                    inverted triangle or ‚Äúapple‚Äù shape.
                    Stylists may recommend tops that have some shaping around the waist and more open necklines, or
                    clothing that shows off your legs.

            <section>
                <h2>Hourglass</h2>
                <p>If your hips and bust are nearly equal in size and you have a well-defined waist that‚Äôs narrower than
                    both, you have an hourglass shape.
                    Your legs and upper body are probably considered proportionate.
                    Your shoulders may be slightly rounded, and you most likely have a rounded buttocks.
                    Form-fitting or tailored clothing have traditionally been designed with this body type in mind.

            <section>
                <h2>Rectangle</h2>
                <p>If your waist measurements are about the same as your hip or bust, and your shoulders and hips are
                    about the same width, you have what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúbanana‚Äù or rectangle body type.
                    Stylists will probably point you toward off-the-shoulder tops, tube dresses, and belted waists.
